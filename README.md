## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first time using custom fonts in CSS without embeding them using link. I've learnt to use **@fontface** in CSS to import fonts.

```css
 @font-face{
   font-family: Hanken;
   src: url(./assets/fonts/HankenGrotesk-VariableFont_wght.ttf);
 }
```
### Continued development

I would like to start using CSS grids for my layout because I have been using flexbox all the time.
